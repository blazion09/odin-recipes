  <h2>Description</h2>
  These Russian tea cakes are rolled in powdered sugar for a sweet finish and a snowball-like appearance. My grandmother
  "Bubba" brought this Russian tea cake recipe with her when she came from Lithuania, and now my family has made it for
  many generations. I pass it on in the true spirit of the holiday season!
  <p> Russian tea cakes (a.k.a. snowball cookies) are incredibly easy to make with pantry staples. The
    melt-in-your-mouth dessert is a simple way to satisfy your sweet tooth during the holiday season. </p>
